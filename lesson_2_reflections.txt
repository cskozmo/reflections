What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository you create a hidden folder called .git
that Git uses to track your changes and whatnot. You need to do it so
you can start using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different because it is only the files that are being worked
on and changed in a particular commit, whereas the working directory and
the repository are the entire project. The value comes from being able to just
focus on the files that actually change, rather than putting the entire
working directory into the repository for each commit.
