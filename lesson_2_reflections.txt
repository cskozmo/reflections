What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository you create a hidden folder called .git
that Git uses to track your changes and whatnot. You need to do it so
you can start using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different because it is only the files that are being worked
on and changed in a particular commit, whereas the working directory and
the repository are the entire project. The value comes from being able to just
focus on the files that actually change, rather than putting the entire
working directory into the repository for each commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use the staging area to check the differences between the files you
have worked on and what is in the most recent commit and use that information
to commit after each logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Using branches would be helpful whenever you are making changes that you
don't want to affect your main version. This could be because you are using the
main version as a base and creating something different or because you are
trying things with your code that might not work yet and want to retain a
working version.
