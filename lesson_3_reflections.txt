When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository allows one to access their work from any computer that has
internet access in addition to acting as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
For many of the same reasons you don't want to git to automatically make commits.
A big one being that you don't want your changes to be interfered with any
changes that might be made while you are working on a local file.
